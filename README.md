# HW1
This project allows us to understand the website is setup and understand what HTML and CSS can do to transform a blank slate into a full fledge, working website. I had labeled 
the HTML on which part is which and how it operates the website, as well as making a few tweaks in the website. Tweaks made were the favicon, and having the "Search Engine Optimization" tab
link to the Search Engine Optimization Panel.
